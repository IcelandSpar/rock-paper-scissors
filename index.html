step 1: generate random number between 1-3 (1 - rock, 2 - paper, 3 - scissors); store in variable
step 2: turn number value to corresponding string: rock, paper or scissors; store in variable choice made by computer
step 3: code checks if you chose rock paper or scissors and stores choice in variable
step 4: code checks variable choice made by player against random guess (paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, if answers are the same it is a tie)
step 5: prints result to console.
